## Images That Need Replacement

The following images need to be replaced with high-quality images that better align with Earth Nexus Lab's mission and content:

1. **Banner Image**: `/images/earth-data-visualization.jpg`
   - An image showing Earth with data visualization elements or researchers collaborating across environmental science and economics

2. **Mission & Vision Image**: `/images/global-research-network.jpg`
   - An image depicting a global research network or researchers collaborating on environmental-economic challenges

3. **Key Activities Image**: `/images/environmental-economic-research.jpg`
   - An image showing research activities, workshops, or data analysis related to environmental economics

4. **Research Community Image**: `/images/diverse-research-collaboration.jpg`
   - An image showing diverse researchers collaborating or a global community working together

## How to Replace Images

1. Find appropriate high-resolution images (at least 1200px wide) that match the descriptions
2. Optimize the images for web use (compress them without losing quality)
3. Name the files as specified above
4. Place the images in the `/static/images/` directory

## Recommended Free Image Sources

- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) - Search for terms like "environmental research", "data visualization", "global collaboration"
- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) - High-quality free stock photos
- [NASA Images](https://images.nasa.gov/) - Excellent source for Earth imagery and climate visualization
- [NOAA Photo Library](https://photolib.noaa.gov/) - Environmental and climate research imagery

## Image Selection Tips

1. **Maintain Visual Consistency**: Choose images with similar style and color tones (greens and blues work well with the Earth Nexus Lab brand)
2. **Represent Diversity**: Select images that show diverse researchers and global representation
3. **Focus on Quality**: Only use high-resolution, professional-looking images
4. **Consider Content Alignment**: The images should clearly connect to the text they accompany
5. **Check Licensing**: Ensure you have the right to use the images (most sites above provide free-to-use images)

## Technical Requirements
