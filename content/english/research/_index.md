## Research Focus

At Earth Nexus Lab, we conduct interdisciplinary research at the intersection of environmental science and economics. Our work aims to develop data-driven approaches for sustainable development, informed financial decision-making, and effective policy formulation.

## Key Research Areas

### Environmental Economics

We investigate economic activities related to environmental resources, focusing on monitoring, quantifying, analyzing, and recommending policies that promote sustainability while acknowledging economic realities.

### Open Science

We are committed to open science principles, sharing our research tools, code, papers, and data publicly to foster collaboration, reproducibility, and knowledge advancement across disciplines.

### AI and Remote Sensing Applications

We leverage artificial intelligence and remote sensing technologies to monitor environmental changes, predict economic impacts, and develop innovative solutions for sustainable resource management.

### Quantitative Finance and Supply Chain Strategies

We research how financial markets and supply chains can be optimized to support sustainable practices and reduce environmental impacts across global economic systems.

## Current Projects
